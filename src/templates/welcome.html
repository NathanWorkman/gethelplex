<div class="collapse" id="glossary">
  <p>
    There are many types of substance abuse treatment available. 
    No single type of treatment is appropriate for all individuals.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Assessment</dt>
    <dd class="treatment-definition">According to SAMHSA’s Treatment Improvement Protocol Series, No.51, assessment is a process for defining the nature of that problem, determining a diagnosis, and developing specific treatment recommendations for addressing the problem or diagnosis.</dd>

    <dt>Medical Detox</dt>
    <dd class="treatment-definition">According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, medical detox manages the acute physical symptoms of withdrawal associated with stopping drug use.</dd>

    <dt>Outpatient</dt>
    <dd class="treatment-definition">Outpatient treatment programs provide treatment at a variety of sites, but the person lives elsewhere.  Many meet in the evenings and on weekends so participants can go to school or work. Out-patient treatment programs have different requirements for attendance. Some programs require daily attendance; others meet only one to three times per week (What is Substance Abuse Treatment? A Booklet for Families, SAMHSA).</dd>

    <dt>Intensive outpatient program (IOP)</dt>
    <dd class="treatment-definition">Intensive outpatient programs typically meet 3-5 days a week for 2-4 hours a day or more. Relapse prevention is often a major focus of IOP. Typically outpatient programs are often scheduled around work or school.</dt>

    <dt>Residential</dt>
    <dd class="treatment-definition">Residential programs provide a living environment with treatment services. Several models of residential treatment (such as the therapeutic community) exist, and treatment in these programs lasts from a month to a year or more, according to SAMHSA’s, “What is Substance Abuse Treatment?  A Booklet for Families.</dt>

    <dt>Medication Assisted Treatment</dt>
    <dd class="treatment-definition">The text should read:  Medications are used in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies to provide a whole-patient approach to the treatment of substance use disorders (SAMHSA).</dt>
